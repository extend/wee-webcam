This project is a work-in-progress to deliver a complete solution for
webcam integration in the Web:Extend framework. It will attempt to
provide both a general purpose binary build and a modifiable source
for more custom solutions.

The project uses haXe to generate the SWF file. The project is tested
against the red5 server exclusively at this point.

To compile the source the command "haxe compile.hxml" should do the trick.

To test it you need to install red5 and enable the oflaDemo application.
Detailed documentation will be available at a later time.

The license is LGPL v2 or higher and the work copyrighted Dev:Extend.
